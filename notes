embedding basically outputs different lane instances    in output entrte image is seperated into a number of lane classes



this two branch thing is done to handle a variable number of lanes,


in particular, the neural network takes as input the image
and is optimized with a loss function that is tailored to the
lane fitting problem
h a loss function that is tailored to the
lane fitting problem. An inherent advantage of the proposed
method is that the lane fitting is robust against road plane
changes


To increase performance, both in terms of
speed and accuracy [27], these two parts are jointly trained
in a multi-task network
